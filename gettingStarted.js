What is Vue.js?

    - Vue.js is a JavaScript framework that makes building interactive and reactive
    web frontends ( browser-side web applications) easier


- Different ways of utilizing Vue:
    - Vue can be used to control parts of HTML pages or entire pages
        - can use Vue to create 'widgets'
            - widget appoach on a multi-page-application. Some pages are still rendered
            on and served by a backend server
        - the other way of using Vue, is to control the entire frontend of a web application
            - this is the single-page-application (SPA) approach. Server only sends one HTML
            page, thereafter, Vue takes over and controls the UI
- Vue Alternatives:
    - Vue.js is a complete component-based UI framework, includes most core features. A
    bit less popular than React & Angular
    - React.js is lean and focused component-based UI library. Certain features (e.g. routing)
    are added via community packages.
    - Angular is completely component-based UI framework, packed with features. Uses TypeScript.
    Can be overkill for smaller projects.
