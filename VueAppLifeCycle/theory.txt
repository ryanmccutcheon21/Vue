createApp({...})

beforeCreate() // first lifecycle that is reached. Called before the app has
been fully initialized

created() // called after beforeCreate. Still have nothing on the screen
                -> Compile Template  // now the template is compiled. All 
                dynamic placeholders and interpolation are replaced with the values

beforeMount()  // means this is right before Vue will render something on the sceen

mounted()  // we see something on the screen now

Mounted Vue Instance  

Data Changed

beforeUpdate() // when data is changed, it triggers a new lifecycle 

updated() // the update is visible on the screen. We don't reach mounted
again because the template was never unmounted





App can be unmounted:

- instead of data being changed after mounted vue instance, the diagram
shows instance unmounted 

Instance unmounted

beforeUnmount()

unmounted() // nothing is rendered on the screen from vue now
